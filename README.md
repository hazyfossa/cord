Cord is a set of low-level tools to interact with containers from python. It is designed to be modular, so you can use just the features you need.

This project is in pre-alpha and is not ready for general use yet. No API stability between versions is guaranteed.

## Caveats
Cord heavily uses bleeding edge dependencies, including linux kernel features, with the expectation that when the project reaches it's beta stage, those are considered stable.

Linux is the only supported platform (at least for alpha).

## Roadmap
**TBD**
